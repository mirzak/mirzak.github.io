Welcome to the page where I describe my self and my intentions with this site.

I am an experienced technologist with deep expertise in designing and developing Linux-based connected embedded systems,
delivering projects across industries such as automotive, manufacturing, and
biotech.

I thrive at the intersection of hardware and software, building secure,
scalable, and efficient systems that power innovative products. My expertise
spans the full development lifecycle—from architecture and software development
to cloud integration and deployment—ensuring seamless connectivity and
performance.

In addition to embedded systems, I have expertise in cloud-native technologies
and over-the-air (OTA) software update frameworks, enabling seamless, secure,
and reliable software delivery across distributed devices. I specialize in
building resilient, scalable solutions that bridge embedded and cloud systems,
unlocking new capabilities in IoT, edge computing, and connected infrastructure.

Beyond technical execution, I enjoy mentoring teams, fostering collaboration,
and driving best practices in software engineering. I excel at tackling complex
challenges, optimizing system performance, and staying up date with emerging
trends in embedded software, cloud computing, and distributed systems.

I am passionate about open-source as this is a big part of my everyday work
life and I am proud to be involved and have contributed to various projects and
I will continue doing it for a long time I believe.

My passion for open-source is one of the biggest reason on why I decided to
start this site as I believe in sharing and I would not have been here today if
other people did not share their knowledge in various forms. Now it is time for
me to share some of my knowledge and hopefully it will be helpful to someone.
I am also hoping to learn from my readers and any feedback (good/bad) is more
then welcome.

I will mostly focus on writing three types of posts:

- Tutorials (tips and tricks)
- Evaluations of different open-source projects/tools
- Misc open-source related topics

If you have any interesting topics that you would like me to cover or research
please get in touch and I will take it in to consideration.
