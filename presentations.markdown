Below are pointers to slides (and some [videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLchghmIxIsy29b0AsRtWVJP3Rxo68cshN))
from various conference presentations that I've given.

* Linux IoT: From Prototype to Production ([video](https://youtu.be/WYO3VlRJg7I){:target="_blank"}) -- [OpenEmbedded Workshop 2020](https://pretalx.com/oe-workshop-2020/cfp){:target="_blank"}; February 3 2020, Brussels, Belgium

  Short (20min) presentation on considerations when building Internet of
  Things (IoT) products based on embedded Linux and
  [OpenEmbedded](https://www.openembedded.org).

* Approaches in Optimizing BSP for Your Embedded Project ([video](https://youtu.be/9-WNikqy8uk){:target="_blank"}) -- [OpenEmbedded Workshop 2020](https://pretalx.com/oe-workshop-2020/cfp){:target="_blank"}; February 3 2020, Brussels, Belgium

  BSP = Board Support Package

  Short (20min) presentation on the four main components of an embedded Linux
  design, which are toolchain, bootloader, kernel, root filesystem and then how
  they are combined into a basic embedded Linux system.

  Best approaches are also discussed on how to best structure your
  [OpenEmbedded](https://www.openembedded.org) BSP layer.

* Challenges of Internet of Things at scale ([video](https://youtu.be/TsvaVF7bIjo){:target="_blank"}) -- [CfgMgmtCamp](https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/ghent2020/){:target="_blank"}; February 3-5 2020, Ghent, Belgium

  The Internet of Things (IoT) is the extension of Internet connectivity into
  physical devices and everyday objects. Embedded with electronics, internet
  connectivity, and other forms of hardware (such as sensors), these devices
  can communicate and interact with others over the internet, and they can be
  remotely monitored and controlled.

  This means that internet connected devices are moving out of the data centers
  and into a new environment which brings a range of new challenges. A
  dominating technology in this area is GNU/Linux and although best practices
  have been established for GNU/Linux in the desktop and server world, the IoT
  space is still in its infancy and is most accurately comparable to the wild
  west due to the vast options in hardware configurations and software stacks.

  In this presentation I go over specific areas within this space,
  highlight the challenges and how they are solved today using open-source
  technologies. We will also take a closer look on some of the trends that are
  emerging, as “server technologies” are moving towards the edge devices.

* Managing your Qt based embedded Linux device using Mender.io ([video](https://youtu.be/We59oJ3Kk58){:target="_blank"}, [video](https://youtu.be/cn-zo2DVmic){:target="_blank"}) -- Webinar Qt + Mender.io

  In this webinar Harald Kjølberg from Qt and Mirza Krak from Mender.io will
  show you how to use Mender.io to quickly and easily deploy applications made
  in Qt on to your field-deployed devices.
