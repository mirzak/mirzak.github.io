title:  "Hello World!"
---

I think it suitable to start out with a “Hello World” post as this is a familiar way of introducing our self to new ventures, be it a new programming language or framework.

To not repeat my self I have written an [About](https://mkrak.org/about/) page which should provide you with an introduction of my intentions and who I am.

I am currently working on writing a series of posts with which will cover **software updates on embedded devices running Linux**. Stay tuned for more!
