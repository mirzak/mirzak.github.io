I am writing this post from Portland, Oregon. I am here because of the Embedded
Linux Conference where I am also presenting a talk on
[how to integrate an open-source software update solution on your board](https://elciotna18.sched.com/event/6239fc0d5ecd64fcddb0e195c12ad475). If you are in the area please stop by or get
in touch and lets grab a bear/coffe/whateva :).

This is my first visit to the United States of America and so far it has been a
pleasant experience, I arrived last night and have been able to walk around a
bit, seeing the city and socializing. Today I will be busy with the conference
which is packed with interesting sessions.

I have also registered for the
[SiFive Hackathon](https://www.sifive.com/blog/2018/03/03/all-aboard-part-11-risc-v-hackathon-presented-by-sifive/), which is co-hosted with ELC. I will probably not have time to focus on the
competitions but I am hoping on doing some kind of hacking on the
Freedom U540-C000, the world’s first Linux-capable RISC-V ASIC. First step is
probably to setup an Yocto build and boot it on the real hardware, I have tried
this with an qemu with successful result and hopefully the transition to real
hardware is not that painful.

I am planing on writing a article to summarize the full experience of ELC and
and the
[SiFive Hackathon](https://www.sifive.com/blog/2018/03/03/all-aboard-part-11-risc-v-hackathon-presented-by-sifive/),
so stay tuned! I will also be posting on the event continuously on my
[Twitter account](https://twitter.com/KrakMirza), follow if you are interested.

I still plan on continuing on writing on my “Updating embedded Linux devices”
article series when I get back home and the next project that I will cover is
[libostree](https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
