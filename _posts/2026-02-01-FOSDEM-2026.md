FOSDEM 2026 is a wrap! Here are my highlights.

# Day 0

Attended the "Friends of Mender.io" dinner. Great catching up with old friends,
and making new ones. After-party at Delirium, as is the FOSDEM tradition.

# Day 1

Late start to the day as a consequence of 'Day 0'.

Hoped to get in to the Python room, but others had the same idea and they
queued up in time and I was met with a sign saying "Sorry, this room is full".
This is a very FOSDEM thing, and was expected due to my poor planning. Luckily
there are video records of all talks and I hope to catch up on:

* [The Bakery: How PEP810 sped up my bread operations business](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/HAAABD-the_bakery_how_pep810_sped_up_my_bread_operations_business/)
* [The GIL and API Performance: Past, Present, and Free-Threaded Future](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/ABJMWD-the_gil_and_api_performance_past_present_and_free-threaded_future/)
* [Modern Python monorepo with `uv`, `workspaces`, `prek` and shared libraries](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/WE7NHM-modern-python-monorepo-apache-airflow/)
* [Ducks to the rescue - ETL using Python and DuckDB](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/S7RELZ-ducks_to_the_rescue_-_etl_using_python_and_duckdb/)

With my hopes lost of joining the Python devroom, I roamed the hallways and
chatted with people instead. Which is also a very FOSDEM thing.

I do like well structured pull requests, and therefore joined
[Pull requests maintainers will love to review](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/L7ERNP-prs-maintainers-will-love/)
on the 'Main Track'. [Alya Abbot](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/alya_abbott/)
did a great job distilling what makes up a good pull request and how they
communicate this at [Zulip](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html).

I have received several recommendations to watch [How to Make Package Managers Scream](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DCAVDC-how_to_make_package_managers_scream/)
(also Main Track), and I intend to! Having worked with Yocto Project and
packaging a large variety of software, I fear that I have already experienced
some of the horror stories.

# Day 2

Day 2, I had three goals:

1. Join the 'Go' devroom in the morning

   Right now involved in a 'Go' project, and wanted to hear about the latest
   and greatest in the community. The trending features are
   [testing/synctest](https://go.dev/blog/synctest) &
   [Green Tea GC](https://go.dev/blog/greenteagc).

   Also enjoyed
   [Modularizing a 10-Year Monolith: The Architecture, the People, and the Pain](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/MCH3DR-go-modular-monolith-refactoring/)
   which has some similarities with my current project with similar conclusions,
   large architectural changes are about people more then tech.

2. Join [The Year in Embedded Security](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/KPCRXF-the-year-of-embedded-security/)
   presentation in the 'Embedded, Mobile and Automotive' room

   Always enjoy talks by [Marta Rybczynska](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/marta_rybczynska/), and
   the topic is close at heart.
3. Watch Daniel Stenbergs (curl://) keynote

   More on this later.

Mission successful!

## Lightning lightning talks

Anticipating a packed Janson room for Daniels keynote, I joined earlier to make
sure I had a good spot. It was a round of lightning talks and noted down some
links that stood out to me:

* [https://tc54.org/contributing-yaml](https://tc54.org/contributing-yaml) - a machine readable `CONTRIBUTING.MD`
  sounds like a great idea for AI agents and other tools
* [https://pgscorecard.com](https://pgscorecard.com) - many "PostgreSQL compatible" databases are using false marketing
* [https://rcl-lang.org](https://rcl-lang.org) - code once, generate config everywhere. You can also query JSON
* [https://body.build](https://body.build) - fitness and open source, two of my passions

## Open Source Security in spite of AI

One of the highlights each year at FOSDEM is the Daniel Stenberg (curl://)
keynote, and this year did not disappoint with insights on how AI is impacting
open source.

Conclusion, AI is a tool which can be used for good and for bad. Open source
projects are overrun by "slop" which is stealing valuable time from maintainers.
"Slop" security reports are more time consuming to handle then "slop" pull
requests.
