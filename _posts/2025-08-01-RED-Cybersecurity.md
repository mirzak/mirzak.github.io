To enhance the cybersecurity of certain radio products in the European Union
(EU) market, the European Commission has adopted a Delegated Act (Regulation
(EU) 2022/30) under the RED, which takes effect on 1 August 2025.

This Delegated Act enforces the following essential requirements from Article 3
of the RED:

* 3.3(d): Ensure network protection – radio equipment must not harm the network
          or its functioning nor misuse network resources.
* 3.3(e): Incorporate safeguards to ensure the personal data and privacy of the
          user and subscriber are protected.
* 3.3(f): Include features to protect against fraud

Harmonized standards:

* UNE EN 18031-1:2025 Common security requirements for radio equipment - Part 1: Internet connected radio equipment
* UNE EN 18031-2:2025 Common security requirements for radio equipment - Part 2: radio equipment processing data, namely Internet connected radio equipment, childcare radio equipment, toys radio equipment and wearable radio equipment
* UNE EN 18031-3:2025 Common security requirements for radio equipment - Part 3: Internet connected radio equipment processing virtual money or monetary value
